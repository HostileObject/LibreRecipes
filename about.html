						<p class="section-paragraph">
							This project tries to showcase how modern web loads a bunch of useless scripts, 
							putting a heavy, unwanted, easy-avoidable charge on the bandwith of the person 
							loading the page. This website tries to demonstrate what you can do with only 
							CSS and HTML: a totally functional website, that looks good, functions as espected
							and doesn't slow down nor your computer nor your network.

						<p class="section-title">"Bloat"</p>
						<p class="section-paragraph">
							Bloat is the part of a program/script/website/etc... that isn't required by the program to run 
							and/or uses more memory, processing power, disk space. 
							The term "Bloat" is quite subjective but we can agree that things like telemetry, functions that 
							aren't related to the program's original service, and things like cookies can be considered bloat.

							Our  <a href="https://github.com/HostileObject/LibreRecipes">GitHub</a> has all the instructions and templates needed to add a recipe to the website. If you want to 
							contribute but don't really know how even after reading the instructions email me at <a href = "mailto: samueletonarini@gmail.com">samueletonarini@gmail.com</a> 
							and I will happily answer. In our recipes pages we only accept the ingredient list, the explanation and a maximum of 5 photos.
							At the bottom of the page there's a section where the author can link to his website or other recipes.
							For more information visit our <a href="https://github.com/HostileObject/LibreRecipes">GitHub</a> page.

							I would love to create a small series of minimalist, "community"-driven websites.
							When another project is created will be refenced here. The aim of this project and the 
							future ones is to inspire more people to create minimalist, bloat-free websites; So if this 
							website inspired you, just send me an email at <a href = "mailto: samueletonarini@gmail.com">samueletonarini@gmail.com</a>
							and your project will be featured here!
